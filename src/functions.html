        <p>Functions are the bread and butter for most programming languages, and that fact is true with their implementation into JavaScript. Functions can be viewed functionally as "steps" to completing a logical process, and can be repeated or reused as many times as possible without being physically rewritten by a programmer, a good relatable example is like baking cookies. Each individual cookie is made using the same process, which could be made into a single function, which would be inside the process of creating a batch of cookies.</p>
